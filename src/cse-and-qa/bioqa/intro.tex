\chapter{Getting Ready for a Biomedical Question Answering System}

In this task, you won't need to write any code (except that you need to edit
your Wiki page in Github flavored markdown language), instead you will learn a
new biomedical question answering task. Plus, we will also mention how to create
Milestones and Issues in the GitHub ISSUES system. Finally, you will create your
own question answering system based on an archetype framework called
\texttt{hellobioqa} we built for you.

We encourage you to go over the CSE Tutorial (which can be downloaded from the
blackboard) to know the baseqa framework for the question answering framework.
If you are still unsure how to create a repository on GitHub, or how to create a
Maven project from an archetype, we also recommend you to take a look at
Homework 0 and 1 again.
